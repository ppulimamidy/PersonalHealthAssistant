Great — since you already have a comprehensive schema for the **VitaSense Personal Physician Assistant**, I’ll now map out a complete set of **FastAPI-style RESTful API endpoints**, grouped by domain.

These endpoints assume:

* REST principles (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* Supabase or PostgreSQL backend
* Auth handled via headers or middleware
* You may optionally split into microservices later (e.g., AI, medical, device)
